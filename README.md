# luzifer / tractest

## Installation

```
$ git clone git://github.com/Luzifer/tractest.git
$ cd tractest
$ vagrant up
```

This is everything. Vagrant will boot up an amd64 Ubuntu server with Trac=0.11 and you can access [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) after provisioning is finished successfully.

To make modifications simply edit the `trac` directory on the host machine in `tractest` (where you executed `vagrant up`).
